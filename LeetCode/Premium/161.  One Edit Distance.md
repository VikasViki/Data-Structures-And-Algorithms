# One Edit Distance

**Problem Description:**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are both one edit distance apart. An edit is defined as an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: s = "aDb", t = "adb"
Output: true

Input: s = "ab", t = "ab"
Output: false
```

**Function Signature:**

```python
class Solution:
    """
    @param s: a string
    @param t: a string
    @return: true if they are both one edit distance apart or false
    """
    def is_one_edit_distance(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_len = len(s)
        t_len = len(t)

        if abs(s_len-t_len) > 1:
            return False
        
        # Always t will be smaller
        if s_len < t_len:
            s, t = t, s
            s_len, t_len = t_len, s_len
        
        # one char is inserted in s
        if s_len != t_len:
            s_index = 0
            t_index = 0
            mismatch_char_count = 0
            while t_index < t_len:
                if s[s_index] != t[t_index]:
                    s_index += 1
                    mismatch_char_count += 1
                    if mismatch_char_count == 2:
                        return False
                else:
                    s_index += 1
                    t_index += 1
                
            return mismatch_char_count <= 1
        
        # one mismatch character
        else:
            mismatch_char_count = 0
            for s_char, t_char in zip(s, t):
                if s_char != t_char:
                    mismatch_char_count += 1
                if mismatch_char_count == 2:
                    return False
            
            return mismatch_char_count == 1

```

**Constraints:**

- The lengths of `s` and `t` are between 0 and 10^4.
- Strings `s` and `t` consist of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.

**Hints:**

- Consider the possible cases: the strings have the same length, `s` is longer than `t` by one character, or `t` is longer than `s` by one character.
- Iterate through the strings to find the first differing character and determine if the remaining substrings are identical after accounting for one edit.
