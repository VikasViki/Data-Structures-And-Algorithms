## 2534. Time Taken to Cross the Door

### Problem Statement
You are given `n` persons numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and a door. Each person can enter or exit through the door once, taking one second.

You are given:
- A **non-decreasing** integer array `arrival` of size `n`, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `i`th person at the door.
- An integer array `state` of size `n`, where `state[i]` is:
  - `0` if person `i` wants to enter.
  - `1` if person `i` wants to exit.

#### Rules for Using the Door
- If **two or more persons** want to use the door at the same time, they follow these rules:
  1. If the door was **not used** in the previous second, the person who wants to **exit** goes first.
  2. If the door was **previously used for entering**, the person who wants to **enter** goes first.
  3. If the door was **previously used for exiting**, the person who wants to **exit** goes first.
  4. If multiple persons want to go in the **same direction**, the person with the **smallest index** goes first.
- Only **one person** can cross the door at each second.
- A person may arrive and **wait** before crossing to follow the above rules.

### Output
Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` represents the **time** at which the `i`th person crosses the door.

### Examples

#### Example 1
**Input:**
```plaintext
arrival = [0,1,1,2,4]
state = [0,1,0,0,1]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[0,3,1,2,4]
```

**Explanation:**
- At `t = 0`: Person `0` enters (only one at the door).
- At `t = 1`: Person `1` wants to exit, Person `2` wants to enter. Since the door was **previously used for entering**, Person `2` enters.
- At `t = 2`: Person `1` wants to exit, Person `3` wants to enter. Since the door was **previously used for entering**, Person `3` enters.
- At `t = 3`: Person `1` is the only one left, so they exit.
- At `t = 4`: Person `4` is the only one left, so they exit.

#### Example 2
**Input:**
```plaintext
arrival = [0,0,0]
state = [1,0,1]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[0,2,1]
```

**Explanation:**
- At `t = 0`: Person `1` wants to enter, Persons `0` and `2` want to exit. Since the door was **not used before**, exit goes first. Person `0` exits.
- At `t = 1`: Person `1` wants to enter, Person `2` wants to exit. Since the door was **previously used for exiting**, Person `2` exits.
- At `t = 2`: Person `1` is the only one left, so they enter.

### Constraints
- `n == arrival.length == state.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arrival[i] <= n`
- `arrival` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
- `state[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

### Follow-up Questions
- Can you optimize the solution to run in **O(n)** time complexity?
- How would your solution behave if `arrival` were not sorted?
- How would you handle scenarios where multiple people arrive at the same second but have different states?
- Can you implement the solution using a **single queue** or two separate queues (one for entering and one for exiting)?

### Python Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def timeTaken(self, arrival: List[int], state: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        entry_queue = deque()
        exit_queue = deque()
        
        prev_door_state = None
        answer = [None] * len(arrival)

        waiting_queue = deque()
        for person, (arrival_time, door_state) in enumerate(zip(arrival, state)):
            waiting_queue.append((arrival_time, door_state, person))


        time = 0
        while waiting_queue or entry_queue or exit_queue:
            person = None
            # move persons from waiting queue
            while waiting_queue and waiting_queue[0][0] <= time:
                arrival_time, door_state, person = waiting_queue.popleft()
                if door_state == 0:
                    entry_queue.append(person)
                else:
                    exit_queue.append(person)
            
            if entry_queue and exit_queue:
                if prev_door_state == None or prev_door_state == 1:
                    person = exit_queue.popleft()
                else:
                    person = entry_queue.popleft()
            
            elif entry_queue:
                person = entry_queue.popleft()
                prev_door_state = 0

            elif exit_queue:
                person = exit_queue.popleft()
                prev_door_state = 1
            else:
                prev_door_state = None
            
            if person != None:
                answer[person] = time
            
            time += 1
        
        return answer
```
